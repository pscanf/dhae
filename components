Diffie-Hellman nomenclature

Receiver
	Public key
		prime
		generator
		public token
	Private key
		prime
		generator
		private token

Sender
	Message
		encryption token
		payload

These messages are not signed, so you cannot establish the
identity of the sender.

To establish the identity of the sender, you need to know
his public key. To do that, you either need a certificate
authority or to know his public key in advance.

Let's assume now on that the sender's public key is known.
The receiver can now establish the authenticity of the
message. Let's see how.

Receiver
	Public key
		prime
		generator
		public token
	Private key
		prime
		generator
		private token

Sender
	Public key
		prime
		generator
		public token
	Message
		encryption token
		payload
		signature
